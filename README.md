# Tire Retreading Management Software

## 📌 Project Overview
Tire Retreading Management Software is a desktop application designed to help users efficiently manage physical assets (e.g., tires) using **RFID technology**.  
The system enables tracking, management, and reporting of items in a way that is both intuitive and powerful.  
The main goal of the project is to provide a complete management solution that improves asset traceability, reduces errors, and supports real-world operations such as inventory tracking and tire lifecycle management.

## 📌 Hardware Integration (RFID)
The repository includes:
- RFID Reader.ino — Arduino sketch for RFID reader communication
- This script enables the software to interface with RFID tags through a USB/serial-connected reader.
- To use the hardware features:
- Upload the .ino code to your Arduino-compatible reader
- Connect the reader to your computer
- Ensure the COM port is correctly configured in the software

## 🧪 Example Use Cases
- This software can be applied to real-world scenarios such as:
- Tire retreading inventory tracking
- Warehouse object tracking and reporting
- Asset management with RFID tags
- Production line logistics monitoring
